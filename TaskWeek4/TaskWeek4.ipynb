        "7. The Probability Integral Transform (PIT) can be applied to normalize activations by mapping them to a uniform distribution based on their cumulative distribution function (CDF), but it requires accurate PDF or CDF estimation, which is computationally intensive and may introduce instability for high-dimensional data. Using a full-rank covariance estimate for normalization provides complete whitening of features, but it is typically avoided due to its high computational cost, numerical instability, and excessive memory requirements, especially for large models. Instead, compact matrix variants like block-diagonal, low-displacement rank, and Monarch matrices can approximate full-rank covariance matrices while being more efficient and scalable. Sparsification techniques, where a subset of weights or activations are set to zero, can serve as a form of regularization by reducing model complexity and overfitting, but they require careful handling during normalization. Other approaches, such as projections onto convex cones or using group-specific symmetry transforms, can enforce desired properties in activations, such as non-negativity or rotational invariance, and may enhance performance for certain types of data. However, these methods need to be chosen based on the specific model architecture and dataset properties to be effective."
